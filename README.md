Hutanho Kuvana ("Nourishment for Children") is a science-driven initiative designed to combat childhood malnutrition in Zimbabwe through an all-in-one digital nutrition platform. Nutrient deficiency-related diseases such as stunted growth, weakened immunity, and delayed development are a leading cause of under-five mortality in the region.
